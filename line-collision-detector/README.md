This directory is used as the main base directory for build2 commands.


## Build2 cheat sheet
Some of the frequently used build commands:
```
# b clean

# # Create a config
# bdep init --config-create ../bdep-configs/gcc cc config.cxx=g++

```

Build2 is nice, but not widely used, so many will need to skim through it's [docs](https://build2.org/build2/doc/build2-build-system-manual.xhtml)
to fully control how this project is built and managed.
